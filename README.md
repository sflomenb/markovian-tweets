# markovian-tweets

## What is this project?
The idea behind this project is to use Markov Sentence Generation to generate a tweet. The first level is a C/C++ version, which reads one or many tweets from a file and generates a new tweet in that style. The second level is a new version completely rewritten as a web app in JavaScript which took a user's Twitter handle and generated a tweet in their style.
## How to Run
